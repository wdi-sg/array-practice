# Array practice

Complete the following exercises to improve your understanding of arrays in javascript!

#### Instructions:
* In `main.js`, define the functions listed below and test that it works by running it against `helper.test(yourFunction(), yourExpectedValue)`.
* As opposed to manually checking the output every time you run the function, we've written a helper method (`helper.test()`) to help you check whether your code produces the expected output.
* For each function, add 1-2 more test cases to confirm that your function really works.
* Tests have been written for exercises 1-5. Write your own tests for the remaining exercises, like so: `helper.test(yourFunction(), yourExpectedValue)`. Sample inputs and expected outputs are provided in the readme file below.

#### Exercises:

1. Write a JavaScript function which accept a number as input and insert dashes (-) between each two even numbers.
  * Sample input: 025486
  * Sample output: 0-254-8-6

2. Write a Javascript function to find the most frequent item of an array. It should return a string denoting the item and the number of times it occurs in the array.
  * Sample input: [3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
  * Sample output : 'a (5 times)'

3. Write a Javascript function to remove duplicate items from an array (ignore case sensitivity).
  * Sample input : [1, 'a', 'A', 'b', 2, 2]
  * Sample output: [1, 'a', 'b', 2]

4. Write a Javascript function to compute the union of two arrays.

  * Sample input: union([1, 2, 3], [100, 2, 1, 10])
  * Sample output: [1, 2, 3, 10, 100]

5. Write a JavaScript function to merge two arrays and removes all duplicates elements.

  * Sample input: mergeArray([1, 2, 3], [2, 30, 1])
  * Sample output: [3, 2, 30, 1]

6. Write a JavaScript function to remove a specific element from an array.

  * Sample input: removeArrayElement([2, 5, 9, 6], 5))
  * Sample output: [2, 9, 6]

7. Write a JavaScript function to get nth largest element from an unsorted array.

  * Sample input: nthlargest([ 43, 56, 23, 89, 88, 90, 99, 652], 4)
  * Sample output: 89

8. Write a JavaScript function to get a random item from an array.
  * Sample input: randomItem(['hello', 'hi', 'bye'])
  * Sample output: 'hello' // or 'hi', or 'bye'!

9. Write a JavaScript function to generate an array of specified length, filled with integer numbers, increase by a specific step from starting position.

  * Sample input: arrayRange(1, 4, 1))
  * Sample output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

  * Sample input: arrayRange(-6, 5, 2)
  * Sample output: [-6, -4, -2, 0, 2]
